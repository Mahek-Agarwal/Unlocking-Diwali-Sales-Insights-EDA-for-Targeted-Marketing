# Unlocking-Diwali-Sales-Insights-EDA-for-Targeted-Marketing
## Project Description:

This project focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on Diwali sales data to uncover meaningful insights related to **customer behavior, regional demand, and product performance**. The objective is to demonstrate how raw sales data can be transformed into **actionable insights** that support **targeted marketing strategies and business decision-making**, especially during high-impact festive seasons like Diwali.

The analysis was carried out using Python and popular data analytics libraries, with a strong emphasis on **business interpretation rather than just visualization**.

## Business Problem:

Festive seasons generate massive sales volumes, but without proper analysis, businesses may miss:

* High-performing customer segments
* Region-specific demand patterns
* Category-level revenue opportunities

This project answers questions such as:

* Which regions and zones drive the highest sales?
* Who are the most valuable customer segments?
* Which product categories perform best during Diwali?
* How can these insights support targeted marketing?

## Key Insights:

* Certain states emerged as **high-volume sales markets**, while others showed **untapped growth potential**.
* **Female customers** contributed a higher share of total orders, indicating scope for gender-focused festive campaigns.
* Metro regions recorded **higher average order values**, highlighting premium product opportunities.
* **Food, Apparel, Footwear, and Electronics** dominated festive sales.
* Zone-wise analysis revealed clear differences in purchasing behavior across India.
